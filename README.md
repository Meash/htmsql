Created by Martin Schrimpf <martin.schrimpf@tum.de> during the work at the project "Scalable Database Concurrency Control using transactional memory".

This is an attempt to use the Intel TSX for the Concurrency Control in MySQL's storage engine InnoDB which also includes several micro benchmarks that test the limitations and usefulness of Hardware Transactional Memory.


A paper is in progress but has not yet been published.
